# iRacing-Local-LLM-Setup-Assistant
This is a setup for an iRacing Setup Assistant the uses Ollama and Deepseek R1 to locally host a LLM model and create an "iRacing Setup Engineer" that gives advice on setup adjustments using setup notes and theory documents, parses through telemetry data, and searches online to give you the best setup advice that it can.
